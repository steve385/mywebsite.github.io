# mywebsite.github.io

Hi, thanks for visiting.
This is my first website and although is very basic I'm very proud of it.
I used only HTML and CSS because I just stepped into this vast world of web development.
I know that there are many many more steps to come and I will try to enjoy every one of them
as these first few. If you're reading this, enjoy the rest of your day!
